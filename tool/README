I use the Memshot tool because it seems that GAMEXX.DAT files are mapped 
in memory. So if we use dosbox for running Syndicate, we can inspect the 
dynamic of data in memory.

For example :

- launch dosbox and enter the level 1
  # dosbox -conf dosbox.conf MAIN.EXE &
- get the pid 
  # ps -e
- use Memshot
  # ./MemshotFe pid GAME01.DAT [59020 [4]] 
  # ?> s
- move in the game
- use Memshot
  # ?> l

The game reinit if you took the shot at the begining of the level !
