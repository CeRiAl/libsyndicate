Summary :
This project aims to provide an interface to the Bullfrog Syndicate data files (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syndicate_%28computer_game_series%29). This allow to extract sprites, missions properties, etc. It is written in C++ and compile on unices. This project also provide a documentation written in Latex that describe the format of files. 

Origin :
A project named freesynd (http://freesynd.sourceforge.net/) is a free implementation of the game, but the code that access data is obscure, hardly readable and maintainable. So i had the idea to develop a library that could be used by many programs (games, level editors for example), and that could provide a common interface to data.

Usage :
When hobbyist programmer want to develop their game, creating the data part is not a peace of cake. So this library allow them to concentrate on the engine and the implementation of some new features (internet game, fullscreen, etc.).

Dependencies:
The code doesn't need no any third party software. 
There is sample code for using the library that need SDL and the original game. 
There is a document that describe the format of the data files that need Latex and Dia. 
The html documentation of the API needs Doxygen to compile.

 Usage
#######

You should have an environment variable SYNDICATE_DATA_PATH that point to your data directory.
# export SYNDICATE_DATA_PATH=~/Syndicate/DATA
The data files are expected to be uppercase.

For library :
# ./configure [--enable-example] [--enable-doc-latex-pdf] [--enable-doc-latex-html] [--enable-doc-doxygen] [--enable-tool]
# make 

The --enable-example allow to compile examples and need SDL.

The --enable-doc-latex-pdf allow to compile the latex doc and needs latex, dia, and other tools.

The --enable-doc-latex-html compile the latex doc as html and needs hevea. 

The --enable-doc-doxygen-html allow to compile the doxygen doc and needs doxygen.

The --enable-tool allow to compile some tools.

The --enable-all enable all :)

For checking :
# make check

For example :
# cd example 
# make
